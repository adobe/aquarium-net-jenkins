<div>
  Describes when to execute the create image operation. In theory it could use any of the Application State, but on practice 2 are available: ALLOCATED and DEALLOCATE:</br>
  * ALLOCATED - means execute the task immediately, while the worker is still online. That could be troublesome since not all the memory caches could be stored on disks.</br>
  * DEALLOCATE - means when the host is going down, so Fish will stop the VM first, then create image, then will destroy the VM.
